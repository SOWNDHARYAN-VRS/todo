-----------------------------Guidelines to follow while naming API endpoints-------------------------------

1-Use nouns.

2-Use intuitive, clear names.

3-Use lowercase letters.

4-Avoid special characters.

5-Use forward slash (/).

6-Separate words with hyphens.

7-Donâ€™t use file extension.

8-Use camelCase(writing multi-word identifiers with the first word in lowercase and subsequent
words in uppercase, with no spaces or underscores between them) for parameters.

9-Use API versioning(when we get new features or updating existing features ,we have to give support to the
old users so we have to version the api using strategies like uri versioning / header versioning
/parameter versioning).
